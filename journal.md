I created the schematic based off an idea I had earlier this month while I was recovering from surgery. The potentiometer represents this sensor ([text](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1093?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21079227318&gbraid=0AAAAADx9JvTqLg9zwy74-w5SA_EaZEUiu&gclid=CjwKCAjwqKzEBhANEiwAeQaPVZi8htjwfslw9aXX0W6f3hM82SNAaEUgSn64x5SCh09ZUYcPn-D_4BoCBp8QAvD_BwE)) which I already have but could not find as a kicad component. I wrote the code to move the servo based on the heart beat. 

I made the CAD with the flower and finished up my submission.
